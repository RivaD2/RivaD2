## Hi, I'm Riva Davidowski :wave:

**I am a JavaScript engineer who has a passion for:**

 - frontend technologies
 - code reviews 
 - crafting stellar PR's
 - learning about web performance and accessibility
 - working with new tools and languages (Ones I work with but am new to are GraphQL, Docker, TypeScript, Scala, AzureDevOps to name a few)
 
 #### Tid bit more about me:
 
  - I am eager to learn (I like jumping into new territory, whether that be working on the backend or the frontend)
  - I tend to set the bar high for the work I deliver (I really like my work to be nice and clean and I typically obsess a bit about whitespace, indentation, and variable names)
  - I put in :100:% effort and am pretty determined to get the job done
  - Integrity, creativity, curiosity, humor and grit are some of my key attributes I am most proud of
  - I am currently focusing on remembering best practices, improving past and current work, and building features from vanilla JS in React

#### My journey

I transitioned into software engineering because I wanted to use my organizational skills and eye for detail to solve real world problems. I focus my efforts on delivering code that is clean and user focused while learning why certain approaches, solutions, and patterns work (or don't work).

Prior to software engineering I worked for startups in customer support roles, built high end lighting fixtures at an architectural and design firm, walked people through HoloLens demos at Microsoft, and was line chef on two of Seattle's food trucks. My background reflects my curiosity and desire to find an overlap between my talents and interests.

#### Goals

long term goals:
   - Run point on web accessibility and code reviews on a future team while working as a frontend engineer (this could change as I learn more about engineering, I am open minded)
   - Reach proficiency (advanced knowledge) of JavaScript, React, and TypeScript 
   - Understand how to make web pages highly performant and accessible      
   - Gain a advanced understanding of design systems, usage of APIs, serverless technology

 short term goals:
  - Build upon and improve documentation as I build out new projects or work on new features
  - Continue to work towards advanced knowledge of JavaScript while solidifying knowledge of React best practices
  - Improve my current and past projects, working on web performance and accessiblity
  - Keep working and learning while using GraphQL, TS, Scala, React, JS

#### Hobbies and interests outside of coding:
   - I enjoy movies and shows :clapper:	
   - Playing chess :chess_pawn:	
   - Indoor climbing and aerial arts (with a heavy focus on static trapeze) :circus_tent:	 :climbing_woman:
   - Learning languages (Russian, Swedish, German) 
   - Cooking, painting, and tending to my many plants :woman_cook:	:paintbrush:	:potted_plant:	
   - Interested in the story and design behind products and how they work to impact the customer experience.
